            <p>I decided to take a class on programming after studying from some very useful online resources. I was able to teach myself some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. My love for math, logic, and creating things paired with a strong need to wonder why things are the way that they are, has led me to seek career training as a programmer. All of my projects were completed with the assistance of Epicodus coding bootcamp. Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy my work!</p>
